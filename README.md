# SimpleC

A compiler, written using C#, for a C-like language that attempts to be simpler and cleaner to use. It might even be a bit pretty.

Examples of SimpleC source can be found in the directory, TestFiles.sc. These will be used for testing the compiler and vary from as basic as possible to - eventually
covering all common uses.
